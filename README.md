# Virus-Information-Database
Virus Information Relational Database

# Overview

Over the recent years there has been an influx of viruses that have evolved and caused diseases throughouttheplanet.Therefore,thereisaneedtodevelopmethodsorwaystotrackthesediseases and get information from them. In order to this I have implemented a database using SQL.This database keeps a record of 27 different types of viruses and all their related information. Through queries, the researcher/user would be able to find information on particular viruses such as where those viruses originated from, how many vaccines are there for each virus, what is the virus parent virus, what is the virus's length and so on. the user will also be able to delete less important viruses, or update information relating to the viruses too. Below are the system details of the database.

# Entities,Fields,andDataTypes

## VariantEntity

| **Attributes** | **DataType** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **VariantID** | INT(7) | The VariantID acts as the primary key. It is better for primary keys to be numeric because it takes longer for the database to compare string values than numeric values.Hence if the PK is a numeric value,it can be matched and found faster. TheLength of the Primary key is kept at 7 for identification purposes. For example if it is a primary key for a Variant it starts with 101 but if it a primary key for a transmission it starts with 202. |
| **VariantName** | VARCHAR(40) | There might be some variants with long names and some with short names. Hence, it's better to use a flexible data type like VARCHAR as it will save space. |
| **VirusID** | INT(5) | SameasinVirusTable |
| **GeneID** | INT(7) | SameasinGeneTable |
| **Status** | VARCHAR(10) | The status will be inserted as either "active" or "not-active". If "active" is used, then only 6 characters are needed if "not- active" is used then 10 characters are used. Since we do not know how many characters will be used at which instance its better to use VARCHAR as it is more flexible than CHAR and can saves pace. |
| **Origin** | VARCHAR(40) | Some origin locations may have long names,and some have short so it better to use VARCHAR as it is more flexible. |

**Primary**** Key:**VariantID

**Foreign**** Key's:**VirusID,GeneID

## Gene Entity

| **Attributes** | **DataType** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GeneID** | INT(7) | GeneID is a primary key. It is better for primary keys to be numeric as it is faster to match as compared to text. Length explanation is the same with VariantID |
| **GeneType** | VARCHAR(10) | A virus has either DNA or RNA gene and is called a DNA virus or an RNA virus.These genes are further classified as positive single strain or double strain for RNA and DNA. Example of value: "ssRNA(-) ", "dsDNA". As you can seethe length differs for each value therefore it isbetter to useVARCHAR in this case as it is more flexible and saves space. |
| **GeneLength** | INT(11) | Gene lengths can go as high as 11 digits so the best data type to use is INT as the value will be in integers and set it to 11 digits |

**Primary**** Key:**GeneID

## VirusEntity

| **Attributes** | **DataType** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **VirusID** | INT(5) | VirusID is a primary key.It is better for primary keys to be numeric as it is faster to match as compared to text. VirusID pk lengths are shorter, this is also used to identify tables. |
| **VirusName** | VARCHAR(40) | Some viruses have really long names, and some have short names,therefore it is better to use VARCHAR as it is more flexible than CHAR. |
| **Year_Discovered** | INT(4) | Year contains only 4 digits so its better to use INT. |
| **First_Origin** | VARCHAR(40) | Some Origin locations may hav every long names and some would have short names so its better to use VARCHAR over CHAR as it is flexible and will save space.Example of longname:"Democratic Republic Of Congo" |

**Primary**** Key:**VirusID

# Justification of Entities.

As you can see this table has a few many to many relationships. Therefore, to implement a better design many weak entities were used. Now the question is why this database does have so many tables.Well based on my research all these tables are needed as they contain information that is used to track down different kinds of virus. For proper, virus tracing the user should be able to know the gene type as well as the gene length (gene table) this can be used by researchers to do gene sequencing a key important aspect in creating vaccines for viruses.On that note,knowing which parent virus(virus table) the current virus/variant that they are researching id from will help them to understand the current structure of the variant that they are studying. Besides that, researchers should know what host type (host table)and transmission type (transmission table)each variant is using as to know howmuch the virus has evolved hand how contagious it hasbecome. Furthermore, knowing about where the virus has originated from and what locations it has spread will give key insight to how fast it is spreading and how adaptable it is to different geolocations and climates. Knowing which researcher (researcher table) is also working on the virus would help current researchers to collaboratewith eachotheror reference existingwork from these researchers.Lastly, knowing what vaccines (vaccine table) are available for the virus could help researchers in two ways one they will know how to treat the diseases caused by the virus and two they will know if they should move on to research another virus as there is already a cure for the one that they're currently tracking/researching.
